Many users are not satisfied with the fact that the interfaces of some applications are inconvenient, the fonts are small, the pictures are large, the icons are also small, and so on. When registering, there is a large number of forms to fill out, that is, users need to fill out or questionnaire to take a short time, preferably a couple of forms. And also, in many applications, they are obliged to turn on notifications (“Домовенок - уборка, мойка окон”) and issue paid subscriptions in order to create more orders or services. (“YouDo: работа, курьеры, уборка”, “Naimi.kz”)
Users complained that there is no work with application users, that is, technical support and managers do not fulfill their duties and there is no feedback. (“Airo — сервис бытовых услуг”)
